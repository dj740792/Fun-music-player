# Music Player

A simple music player built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

This project was made to practice JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation by building a real, working audio player.

## Features
- Play / Pause
- Next & Previous tracks
- Shuffle mode
- Repeat current track
- Progress bar synced with audio
- Song carousel to switch tracks
- Background theme changes based on the song

## Tech Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Audio API)

## What I Learned
- Handling audio playback with JavaScript
- Managing app state (current song, play state, shuffle, repeat)
- Updating UI based on user interactions
- Writing cleaner, structured JS logic
